## Fullstack todos

Idea of this project to create the same app on different fullstack framework.

## Rules

1. Every app will use the same DB with prisma ORM
2. If it's possible, every app should use tailwind in order to share styles between apps
3. UI npm packages should be avoided

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add Next.js App
- [ ] Add Figma template
- [ ] Add Signal App
- [ ] Add Nuxt App 
- [ ] To be added...
